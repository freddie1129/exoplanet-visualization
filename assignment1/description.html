		<h2>Describe the Dataset</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>What is the subject matter of the dataset (what is it about?)</li>
			<p>This dataset is a collection of 3,573 exoplanets found in the past decades.  Every row in this dataset represents an exoplanet with 25 main attributes, like the mass, identifier, discovery year, radius, etc. This dataset might be updated later as the new exoplanets be discovered, and the visualization of this dataset can benefit to analyze the natural of exoplanets and find the general features of exoplanets.</p>


			<li>What is the origin of the dataset -- how do you think it was
			generated or compiled?</li>
			<p>The dataset is generated from the astronomers’ research results. Someone collected the data of exoplanets found by astronomers and created this dataset. Then a new record is added to the dataset once there is a new exoplanet to be found. The dataset is relatively static in this course assignment, while it would be changed in the real world as the new exoplanets been found.</p>

			<li>Is any cleanup needed before it is usable in a visualisation?
			How would you perform the cleanup?</li>
			<p>Yes. Some values of attributes do not exist in some rows, which are not suitable for visualisation. I plan to find out these items and delete or provide a default value for them according to the different situation as a clean-up of this dataset.</p>

			<li>Does the data need to be pre-processed (e.g. summarised, ...)
				before it can be used in the visualisation that you have in mind?
			How would you perform that pre-processing?</li>
			<p>Whether the data need to be pre-processed depends on the different type of the visualization job.  For this assignment, the data should be pre-processed in some scenario. For example, a statistic processing would be very necessary for drawing a bar chart representing the amount the exoplanets been found in years. While in other cases, like the plot of radium for a list of exoplanets, pre-processing might not be necessary.</p>

			<li>How do you expect (at this early stage) that your visualisation
				application will <i>load</i> the dataset?  E.g. database, from file,
			hard-coded in your javascript program, ...  Why?</li>
			<p>In this project, I’d like to load the dataset from the file. The main reason is that the structure of this dataset is simple and the data size is relatively small, so file processing method is good enough to process this kind of dataset. Even the database can introduce more conveniences to access to data, the maintenance job of the database will increase the complexity of this project and it is not worth to do in this little project.
			</p>

			<li>Can the dataset change, or is it possible that additional data
			is captured that can be used seamlessly in your visualisation?</li>	
			<p>Because the process of finding a new exoplanet is relatively slow, so it is basically safe to process this dataset as a static dataset. However, it is still possible that the dataset changed when a new exoplanet is found. In order to fit this case, a background thread can be used to monitor the change of the dataset file. The visualisation view should be updated automatically once the dataset file change in the background. </p>

			<li>With reference to the Week 2 lecture slides  on diverse taxonomies
				for data, characterise the dataset in the context of these
			considerations:</li>
			<p></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Degree of structuring</li>
				<p>This dataset is a set of structured discrected data items.</p>
				<li>Data source / format</li>
				<p>This dataset is data file, into which the exoplanet data is materialised.</p>
				<li>[DataVis] Data Types</li>
				<p>The type of data in this dataset is attributes data. Each row has 25 value of different attributes.</p>
				<li>Type of Dataset</li>
				<p>The dataset is a flat table.</p>
				<li>Attribute Types</li>
				<p>There are 25 attributes in each exoplanet. Some of them are categorical, like the 25th planet detection status list, others are quantitative attribute.
				</p>
			</ol>

		<h2>Story, Goals, and Style</h2>
		<ol>

			<li>What story will the visualisation tell?</li>
			<p>The visualisation of the exoplanets dataset will display the dataset from different aspects, reveal the general characteristics of exoplanets, and the basic method to find different exoplanets in history.  </p>

			<li>Who is the target audience?</li>
			<p>The target audiences are astronomers and  anyone whos is interested in exoplanet science.
			</p>

			<li>What questions will the visualisation help your audience (not yourself!) to answer?</li>
			<p>A couple of questions will be answered by visualizing the exoplanet dataset. One of them is the relationship between time and attributes of exoplanets, like how many exoplanets were found in every year, the average  radius of exoplanet found in every year, etc. The second one is the statistic value of exoplanet, like the exoplanets’ mass distribution, the comparison of the exoplanet number found in different method, etc. The third one is the combine of the above to, revealing the relationship between the statistic value of some specified attributes and the whole time range or a given time range.
			</p>

			<li>What questions will it help the audience to raise?  (These <i>don't</i> need to be answered
				by your visualisation in itself; perhaps another visualisation would answer them. But your 
				own visualisation triggers your audience to think of other questions they might want to look
			into.)</li>
			<p>The audience might raise some questions related to the planet science, like the similarity between the exoplanets and planets in solar system, the best method to discovery different exoplanets, the distances between earth and other exoplanets, which exoplanet is most similar one to the earth, and so on. </p>

			<li>Are there any dangers of your solution possibly misleading the audience, dependent on the 
			method of visualisation?  If so, what will you do to avoid ethical problems?</li>
			<p>Because this dataset is the whole collection of the exoplanets that human being has found as far, so the audience should not be misled by the works based on this dataset. The visualisation of this dataset should be able to reflect the current situation of exoplanet research field.</p>

			<li>Which of the following two styles do you <i>currently</i> plan for your solution:
				<ol>
					<li>a visualisation that contains only <b>one</b> view/representation, but this representation
					is relatively novel and creative (not your standard bar charts etc);</li>
					<li>one that employs <b>multiple</b> <i>coordinated</i> (or linked) views where each one is a 
					standard method (e.g. a bar chart) but they work together to tell the story.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<p>The second style will be applied in this exoplanet dataset visualisation project. The main reason for this choice is that each exoplanet has up to 25 attributes, and most of them are not related to each other. The multiple coordinated views should be better to show these attributes without missing any details.
